# What are we covering?

- **Data Inventory:** What data do you need, where to obtain it, best practices to maintain it.
- **Watershed Characterization:** What is it and provide an overview of approaches.
- **Data Sufficiency:** Do you have the data you need? Do you have enough data?

\note<1>{Before you get to this portion of any water quality project, do your homework, talk to stakeholders, know what water quality problem or research question you need to answer. This presentation assumes you have done some of that. This presentation focuses on the initial steps of finding and maintaining data, some methods for assessing water quality in watersheds, and evaluating if you have enough data to answer water quality related questions.}

While you are scoping and planning a project:

- Identify stakeholder concerns
- Identify watershed goals
- Define conceptual models

:::

::::

\note<1>{Your project scoping period helps determine data needs. A lot of this is established by watershed planning processes. What questions do you need to answer? For example, you may not have a good grasp on what the general water quality is or maybe you are trying to track the source(s) of the impairment. Or you know the problem but don't know what is needed to improve water quality. Finally, maybe you just need to evaluate if progress is being made. This will help you define the required models or approaches, and define the data oyu need to gather or collect.}

# Locating information

What types of data will you need?

\note<1>{Can anyone tell me some general types of data you might want for a water quality assessment or watershed characeterization project} 

---

# Locating information

What types of data will you need?

- Watershed physical characteristics
- Water quality
- Streamflow
- Climate
- Pollutant sources


\note<1>{Besides water quality data, you will want information on waterbodies and the physical contributing watershed. For most projects you will want to have at least a basic grasp of potential point and non-point sources of pollution. If you are doing any modeling work, you will probably need more detailed climate, streamflow, and other data such as soil types, land use. land cover, crop types, and other model specific data.}

There is a pre-defined watershed boundary dataset as well that may or may not be suitable for your project area. The multi-resolution land characteristics consortium or MRLC is a group of federal agencies that provide data for land cover, tree canopy, imperviousness over the US. The USDA NRCS also provides data on soil types with numerous associated characteristics.

The federal government provides a portal for water quality data which combines state program collected data with various federal agency collected data. Hydroshare is a primarily academic data repository that includes monitoring as well as modelling data. Parks and Wildlife has plenty of data used in bioassessment and fisheries survey studies. And citizen science data is available and particularlly well suited for identifiy potentially problemenatic areas that might not be captured in the SWQM dataset.}

# Gather and organize data

Documentation should identify:

- Types of data (monitoring, geographic)
- Source
- Quality
- Representativeness
- Spatial coverage
- Temporal coverage
- Data gaps
- Units and variable names

Your QAPP is a good starting point.

Best practices:

- Consistent terminology and file naming (ex. Nitrate as nitrogen, NO~3~-N, or nitrate...).
- Standardized dates (highly suggest YYYY-MM-DD formatting).
- Use non-proprietary files where possible (plain-text, csv, etc.).
- What are your data storage practices?

\note<1>{This is a good time to get up and strech if you need. Before I jump into the next section of this presentation, are there any questions?}

# What is a Watershed Characterization?

An assessment of past and current conditions within a watershed to support water quality management decisions.

\note<1>{We can consider a watershed characterization several different things. Here I am going to discuss how we assess past and current water quality condtions to support water quality management descisions. But we can also consider characterizations things like spatial or temporal analysis to summarize and quantify all the data we just discussed to provide a snapshot of the current conditions in a watershed, and provide insight to problematic areas, periods of time, or sources of pollution.}

---

# What is a Watershed Characterization?

Can have different objectives:

- Is there a (or where is the) water quality problem?
- Compare and define current and desired conditions.
- Estimate allowable loadings for point source permits or TMDLs
- Evaluate and recommend best management practices
- Assess trends or changes in water quality

(not an exhaustive list...)

\note<1>{There are many reasons we might want to conduct monitoring and data assessments. First  of course, we might be interested in if there is a water quality problem. This is basically what the Clean Rivers Program and TCEQ Assessments is tasked with on a large spatial scale. If we are doing watershed planning, we want to compare current and desired conditions, evaluate or recommend BMPs to acheive desired conditions or acheive reductions outlined in TMDLs. Finally, we may want to report or assess trends in water quality as we implement practices in watersheds. All of this can be done with field data, experiments, statistical analysis, and/or models.}
---

# How do we do it?

*Depends* on our objectives!

Objectives determine the approach and data requirements (monitoring requirements).

\note<1>{There are many ways to accomplish this, and they are all determined by your primary objective that we just saw in the previous slide.}

---

# General approaches

* Reconnaissance
* Plot studies
* Watershed(s) study

\note<1>{Here are a couple of approaches we can take. Reconnaissance study, plot studies, watershed studies. One thing I won't discuss today is using watershed models like SWAT or HSPF to conduct a watersehd assessment or scenario planning. Lucas puts togetehr a workshop with folks from AgriLife Blacklands Center that provide that training.}

---

# Reconnaissance
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Identify if or where there is a water quality problem.

* AKA routine or ambient water quality
* Provides a snapshot of water quality at a given point in time
* Limited statistical application (summary statistics or probability of exceedance)
* TCEQ assessments manual provides baseline methods for comparison.

\tiny Image: Brazos River Authority, Lake Granbury Watershed Protection Plan

\note<1>{A reconnaissance study provides a snapshot of current water quality across a watershed using one or more sites. You can think of the 303d and clean rivers monitoring programs as state-wide or river basin reconnnaissance studies. They help identify places of concern but don't lend themselves to extensive analysis beyond summary statstics or exceedance probabilities. Here we have a map from the Lake Granbury Watershed Protection plan, this map uses ambient data to highlight one spot that is problematic, and helps focus potential implementation efforts.}

---

# Reconnaissance

Advantages:

* You might already have enough data (CRP monitoring)
* Large spatial coverage
* Useful to pinpoint problematic areas

\note<1>{The big advantage of reconnaissance type studies are that it typically uses readily available data and we can quickly pick out potentail problem areas.}

---

# Reconnaissance

Disadvantages:

* Biased towards baseflows
* Possibly low sampling frequency in existing data
* Sampling locations are biased

\note<1>{Data that goes into recommaissance is typically routine monitoring data collected under a range of conditions but is usually biased towards baseflow so is inadequate for assessing loadings or if concerns are primarily non-point source. Routine data is typically collected quarterly to monthly. We miss high flow events or might have difficulty capturing seasonal or short term water quality patterns. Sampling locations are often biased towards bridge crossings or public access sites. What are some reasons biased sampling locations are problematic? Road crossings are heavily influenced by runoff, targets for illegal dumping, can be hard to assess spatial variability if sites are far apart. }

---

# Plot studies

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Objective: Evaluate differences in conditions or treatments

* Experimental trials on multiple plots involving treatment and control replicates. Treatments are small plots where runoff can be routed to a single measurement point per treatment.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/plot.png)



:::

::::

\tiny Image @usdanrcsNationalWaterQuality2003

\note<1>{Plot studies are experimental trials involving field plots, mesocosms, or some type of semi-controlled environment. They are setup to include control and treatment conditions, typically with replicates to provide stronger statistical power. Here is basic example showing an experiment with a contol and three different treatments. This is replicated across three blocks.}


---

# Plot studies

Often used to evaluate the impact of BMPs on runoff quality.

Advantages:

* Well designed experiments have strong statistical power (reliability for detecting true effects).
* Ability to control for environmental conditions.

Disadvantages:

* Cost.
* Conditions may not represent real world conditions.
* Results are sometimes (often?) condition specific.

\note<1>{We often use this kind of experiment to evaluate how practices work in a given condition, watershed, or region. When designed correctly, analysis is straightforward and can account for environemental variability. However, it can potentially be a ton of work, even large plots are the same scale as large ag practices when implemented, and the results are not always transferrable.}

# Plot studies

\note<1>{Here is Lucas in his native habitat, in the process of installing automatted runoff samplers on agricultural BMP plots. Don't underestimate the work to get these experiment up and running. And even though these are huge plots, they are miniscule compare to what an ag producer might actually implement. The scaling of BMP results is an ongoing water quality research challenge.}

---

# Watershed studies



Objective: Evaluate Best Management Practices (BMPs), assess trends.

Multiple potential study designs:

| **Design**            | **Causal factors**  |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Single watershed - before/after | BMPs, Climate |
| Single watershed - upstream/downstream   | BMP,  within watershed factors  |
| Paired watershed - BACI | BMP   |

: {tbl-colwidths="[70,30]"}

\note<1>{Watershed studies are also called natural experiements. We use observational data with different types of study designs. These are generally classified as single or paired watershed studies. Setting up studies this way allows us to evaluate variation over time, but the experimental design is important if you need to seperate climate or other watershed factors from BMP implementation when looking for what is effecting water quality change.}

---


# Single watershed

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Evaluate conditions before and after implementation, or trend analysis.

* Single monitoring site at the outlet of a watershed.
* Relatively inexpensive.
* Difficult to separate effects due to changes climate or other watershed changes.

:::

::::

\tiny Image @usdanrcsNationalWaterQuality2003

\note<1>{Single watershed designs are simple, cheap, and the least logistically challenging. If you observe pre- and post- implementation you can evaluate potential water quality changes, but you generally cannot attribute if the cause was from implementation of BMPs, or changes in climate/runoff.}

---

# Single watershed

:::: {.columns}

Advantages:

* Accounts for some differences within the watershed

\note<1>{This approach is more costly, but may reduce stakeholder uncertaintity depending on your objective. One disadvantge is that the upstream and downstream measurements are not independent, you will still expect the value of the downstream measurement to be somehow related to the upstream measurement.}

---

# Paired watershed


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Evaluate conditions before and after implementation, or trend analysis.

* Monitor before and after in calibration and treatment watersheds
* Two or more watersheds
* One watershed always serves as a control

:::

::::


\tiny Image @usdanrcsNationalWaterQuality2003

\note<1>{For natural experiments, the paired watershed before-after and control-impact study is the ideal approach. Here you have one reference or control watershed and one or more treatment watersheds. They are monitored before and after treatments.}

---

# Paired watershed

Advantages:

* Can be statistically powerful.
* Can evaluate multiple treatments.
* Helps control for environmentally induced variation not associated with treatment.
* Statistical independence between treatment/pre-treatment measurements.
* Regionally relevant results.


\note<1>{These experiments are statistcally similar to plot experiments, but less controlled. We can evaluate multiple treatments if we have enough watersheds. All measurements are independent. We are able to seperately attribute changes in water quality to BMP implementation or natural/climatic variation.}

---

# Paired watershed

Disadvantage:

* Requires long study period.
* Lag effects can be gradual masking difference with control [@mealsLagTimeWater2010].
* Can be hard to find two watersheds that won't have any other disturbances for the entire study period.
* Logistics.

\note<1>{The big disadvantage is you may need a relatively long study period, 3-4 years at least. If there are lag effects (such as expected with sediment bound pollutants) you may not capture the variation. Of course finding two or more watersheds nearby, that won't have major changes for an entire study period is difficult. Expect and document interuptions. Finally these studies can be very logistically challenging.}

---

# Trend analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Assess a trend or change in water quality parameters at a single or multiple location.

* Evaluate effect size over time.
* Doesn't require "reference" watersheds but can be helpful.

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}


![](images/trends.png)

:::

::::

\tiny Image @helselStatisticalMethodsWater2020

\note<1>{Trend analysis is a popular approach for the routine stakeholder question, is water quality getting better or worse? You often see a map similar to this one from Denis Helsel, formerly with USGS, with stations that have significant increases point up, significant decreases pointing down and stations without a likely trend represented as circles. We can use single watersheds or multiple watresheds with this approach. If you have a "minimally distrubed" reference watershed, it is useful to include.}

---

# Trend analysis

Advantages:

* Can use a single station.
* Useful for practices with long-lag times.
* Useful for assessing larger watersheds with many implementation activities.

\note<1>{Big advantages of this approach are the interpretable answers for stakeholders, typically reported as percent change. You can use a single watershed outlet, and you are not neccesarily attributing change to a particular single BMP or group of BMPs. There are also methods for seperating the impact of changes in flow, if you have flow data.}

---

# Trend analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Disadvantages:

* Typically requires long-term data (10-20 years).
* High chance of changes in watershed and lab methodologies.
* Trends are sensitive to the chosen time period.

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/trends_streamflow.png)

\tiny Image @schrammAssessingLinkagesWatershed2023

\note<1>{The biggest disadvantage is that trends aren't really that useful unless you have multiple years of data, often 10 or more years are reccomended. Over time there will be changes in both the watershed, possible lab methods or even measured parameters. Depending on the method you choose, trends can be highly sensitve to starting and ending values, and the time period you choose. In this graph you can see the non-linear smoothed trend in discharge with periods of time that we see clear negative and clear positive trends. If we fit a liner trend test to ten years of data, there is no trend, but 20 years of data show a negative trend. Defining the relevant period of time is important.}

\note<1>{We are almost done, I have a couple of slides left on data sufficiency, but we aren't going into too much detail. Before I start, any questions?}

# Sufficient data

Depends on:

* Statistical design
* Variability of measurement parameters
* Relevant effect size

\note<1>{How do you know if you have enough data to meet your objective? This is going to depend largely on the particular statistical design used, the variability of the water quality paramater (high variability requires more data), and the relevant effect size (percent change or difference in water quality for example) that you need to reliably identify. Large changes or effects can be identified with less data, but small changes need more data.}

# Sufficient data

Things to consider:

* Adequate number of sites
* Adequate number of samples
* Frequency of samples
* Monitoring duration

\note<1>{In addition to the number of samples, consider if you have enough sites to identify spatial patterns or changes, or influences from known sources, are you sampling frequently enough to capture seasonal or (maybe daily) variations? Are you monitoring long enough to capture long term trends and not just short term variation.}

# Sufficient data

Available tools:

* TCEQ assessment criteria (for ambient water quality)
* Statistical power analysis: @helselStatisticalMethodsWater2020 Chapter 13

\note<1>{We could have a whole data on how much data you need, but I'm going to point you to two different resources. First, TCEQ's assessment procedures are very good for general characterization or reconasiance type approaches. They provide clear guidance for duration and sample size needed to make statisically based decisions according to the state's numeric criteria. If you are using a watershed or plot trial, chapter 13 of the USGS stastical methods in water reources handbook, is excellent. This discusses how to do something called power analysis to estimate the statstical power of your approach based on the number of samples and expected variance. Stastical power is essentially how likely your stasstical test is to correctly idenfity an effect when there actually is an effect. We typically aim for a power of 80\% but that is not a hard and fast rule.}

Example power analysis for trend tests on *E. coli* concentrations over 10-years [@schrammEstimatingStatisticalPower2021].

\note<1>{Here is an example of a power analysis I conducted for detecting 10-year trends in E. coli concentrations. If you pick one of these plots, the x-axis shows the number of annual samples needed to achieve the desired stastical power on the y-axis. Each line represents a different effect size, so the light yellow lines represent if we wanted to detect a 10\% reduction in bacteria, even at 12 samples a year, our power is only around 30-40\%. But an 80\% difference can be detected with only 4 samples a year with nearly 100\% power. There are lots of methods for doing power analysis depending on your goals, I don't see it done in our field very often, but I highly reccomend it when you are designing a project. Take a look at the resources at the end of this presentation or reach out to discuss with me.}
