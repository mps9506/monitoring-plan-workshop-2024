## What are we covering?

- **Data Inventory:** What data do you need, where to obtain it, best practices to maintain it.
- **Watershed Characterization:** What is it and provide an overview of approaches.
- **Data Sufficiency:** Do you have the data you need? Do you have enough data?


# Inventory and Acquire Existing Data

::: {.notes}
We are primarily talking about how you acquire, document, and store your data.

## Major steps

While you are scoping and planning a project:

- Identify stakeholder concerns
- Identify watershed goals
- Define conceptual models

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Your project scoping period helps determine data needs.
A lot of this is established by watershed planning processes.
What questions do you need to answer?
For example, you may not have a good grasp on what the general water quality is or maybe you are trying to track the source(s) of the impairment.
Or you know the problem but don't know what is needed to improve water quality.
Finally, maybe you just need to evaluate if progress is being made.
This will help you define the required models or approaches, and define the data oyu need to gather or collect.

Basic Principles:

- Create a project specific data folder or database.
- Maintain living project documentation.
- Use data exploration and summary methods to get a "picture" of the data.
:::
::::

## Gather and organize data

Documentation should identify:

- Types of data (monitoring, geographic)
- Source
- Quality
- Representativeness
- Spatial coverage
- Temporal coverage
- Data gaps
- Units and variable names

Your QAPP is a good starting point.

## Gather and organize data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Best practices:

- Consistent terminology and file naming (ex. Nitrate as nitrogen, NO~3~-N, or nitrate...).
- Standardized dates (highly suggest YYYY-MM-DD formatting).
- Use non-proprietary files where possible (plain-text, csv, etc.).
- What are your data storage practices?

## Gather and organize data
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Spreadsheet best practices:

- No empty cells: specify no value, NA, zero, infinity, etc.
- One value per cell.
- Do not use font color, cell color, or comments, as data.

## What is a Watershed Characterization?

An assessment of past and current conditions within a watershed to support water quality management decisions

## What is a Watershed Characterization?

Can have different objectives:

- Is there a (or where is the) water quality problem?
- Compare and define current and desired conditions.
- Estimate allowable loadings for point source permits or TMDLs
- Evaluate and recommend best management practices
- Assess trends or changes in water quality

(not an exhaustive list...)

## How do we do it?

*Depends* on our objectives!

Objectives determine the statistical design and data (monitoring requirements)

## General approaches

* Reconnaissance
* Plot studies
* Watershed(s) study

## Reconnaissance
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Identify if or where there is a water quality problem.

* AKA routine or ambient water quality
* Provides a snapshot of water quality at a given point in time
* Limited statistical application (summary statistics or probability of exceedance)
* TCEQ assessments manual provides baseline methods for comparison.

:::

::::

## Reconnaissance

Advantages:

* You might already have enough data (CRP monitoring)
* Large spatial coverage
* Useful to pinpoint problematic areas

## Reconnaissance

Disadvantages:

* Biased towards baseflows
* Possibly low sampling frequency in existing data
* Sampling locations are biased


## Plot studies
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Objective: Evaluate differences in conditions or treatments

Experimental trials on multiple plots involving treatment and control replicates. Treatments are small plots where runoff can be routed to a single measurement point per treatment.

## Plot studies

Often used to evaluate the impact of BMPs on runoff quality.

Advantages:

* Well designed experiments have strong statistical power (reliability for detecting true effects)
* Ability to control for environmental conditions

## Plot studies

Disadvantages:

* Cost
* Conditions may not represent real world conditions
* Results are sometimes (often?) condition specific

## Plot studies {background-image="images/plot_ok.jpg" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

Don't underestimate the cost and work needed for plot studies.

## Watershed studies



Objective: Evaluate Best Management Practices (BMPs), assess trends.

Multiple potential study designs:

| **Design**            | **Causal factors**  |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Single watershed - before/after | BMPs, Climate |
| Single watershed - upstream/downstream   | BMP,  within watershed factors  |
| Paired watershed - BACI | BMP   |

: {tbl-colwidths="[70,30]"}


## Single watershed

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Evaluate conditions before and after implementation, or trend analysis.

* Single monitoring site at the outlet of a watershed.
* Relatively inexpensive.
* Difficult to separate effects due to changes climate or other watershed changes.

## Single watershed

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Evaluate conditions before and after implementation, or trend analysis.

* Monitoring before and after implementation.
* Monitor upstream and downstream of implementation.

## Single watershed

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Advantages:

* Accounts for some differences within the watershed
* Costs
 
Disadvantages:

* Downstream measurements are not independent of upstream measurements

## Paired watershed


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Evaluate conditions before and after implementation, or trend analysis.

* Monitor before and after in calibration and treatment watersheds
* Two or more watersheds
* One watershed always serves as a control

## Paired watershed

Advantages:

* Can be statistically powerful.
* Can evaluate multiple treatments.
* Helps control for environmentally induced variation not associated with treatment.
* Statistical independence between treatment/pre-treatment measurements.
* Regionally relevant results.

## Paired watershed

Disadvantage:

* Requires long study period.
* Lag effects can be gradual masking difference with control [@mealsLagTimeWater2010].
* Can be hard to find two watersheds that won't have any other distrubrances for the entire study period.
* Logistics.



## Trends analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Objective: Assess a trend or change in water quality parameters at a single or multiple location.

* Evaluate effect size over time.
* Doesn't require "reference" watersheds but can be helpful.

## Trends analysis

Advantages:

* Can use a single station.
* Useful for practices with long-lag times.
* Useful for assessing larger watersheds with many implementation activities.

## Trends analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Disadvantages:

* Typically requires long-term data (10-20 years).
* High chance of changes in watershed and lab methodologies.
* Trends are sensitive to the chosen time period.
